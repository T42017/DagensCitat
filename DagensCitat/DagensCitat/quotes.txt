If you fall during your life, it doesn't matter. You're never a failure as long as you try to get up.
Riding a motorcycle on today's highways, you have to ride in a very defensive manner. You have to be a good rider and you have to have both hands and both feet on the controls at all times.
Anybody can jump a motorcycle. The trouble begins when you try to land it.
