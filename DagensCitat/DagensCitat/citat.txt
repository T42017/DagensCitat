You can't blame gravity for falling in love
Love has no age, no limit; and no death
Love isn't something you find. Love is something that finds you 
Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn 
Don't walk behind me; I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend 
One of the most beautiful qualities of true friendship is to understand and to be understood 
Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment 
Friends show their love in times of trouble, not in happiness 
As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them 
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts 
The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart
